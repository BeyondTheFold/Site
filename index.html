		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<p>
			Beyond the Fold is a project to visualize a user's path while browsing
			the web. It consists of two software components and one hardware:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A voluntarily installed web extension to monitor a user's relative position</li>
			<li>A visualizing tool that can be used to import the graph from local-storage.</li>
			<li>A device that has lights allowing the end user to highlight a slice of time.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The initial end product was intended to be a physical manifestation of
			the paths through time. It was conceived by <a href="https://github.com/andrewcdoh">Andrew Doherty</a>
			for his graphic design thesis.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each pane of acrylic has a polar coordinate graph containing the path of one's website
			visits. The full circumference of the graph represents 6 hours of browsing in this
			example but can be adjusted in the source. 
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Each circular node is a new page visit.</li>
			<li>Each diamond node is a page visit reached via a search.</li>
			<li>Each connecting line or edge between nodes represents visiting a link from another page.</li>
			<li>Each tab is divided by a separating line.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Monitor</h2>

		<p>The monitor tracks:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Duration of a page visit.</li>
			<li>The parent/child relationship between websites.</li>
			<li>The uniqueness of a page visit.</li>
			<li>Whether the page was reached via. a web search.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Usage</h3>

		<p>
			To install and use the browsing monitor you need Safari and developer tools installed.
			One cannot distribute self-signed web extensions and getting Apple to sign this
			particular extension may be difficult due to perceived invasiveness. 
		</p>

		<p>
		After ensuring developer tools are installed open Safari and execute the 
		following steps:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Clone the project.</li>
			<li>Go to Develop -> Show Extension Builder.</li>
			<li>Click the plus sign in the bottom left corner to add an extension.</li>
			<li>Select Add Extension.</li>
			<li>Select the directory in the cloned project called `Browsing-Monitor.safariextension`.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The browsing monitor is now active and will automatically track you. This data
			is being pushed to the SQLite database in Safari's localstorage.
		</p>

		<h2>Visualizer</h2>

		<p>
			The visualization tool was constructed in a way such that visible page visit's 
			(indicated by a node) can be filtered out by the duration of that visit.
		</p>

		<h3>Usage</h3>		

		<p>
			Install the newest version of processing and open 
			`Visualisation/visualization/visualization.pde`. 
			The graph should be generated based on the data in your Safari localstorage.
		</p>

		<h2>Device</h3>

		<p>
			The final device consisted of an Arduino, LED strips, a sliding potentiometer,
			and a three state switch.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Isolate a single slice.</li>
			<li>Build or highlight all slices up to a selected slice.</li>
		</ul>
